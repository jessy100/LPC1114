// switch a LED on GPIO1_4 by a switch on GPIO0_7
//
// The LED is active high (connected to ground),
// the button is active low (also connected to ground).
// The internal pullup is used for the button.
//
// This is a very simple application.
// It aims to show direct use of the hardware rather than
// good programming practices (like abstracting from the GPIO pin
// used and using a timer for the delay).
//
// It uses the CMSIS header file to access the direction
// and value registers for the pins.
//
// Note that after a reset the pins used here are automatically
// configured as GPIO, hence there is no need to configure
// the pin. Some other pins are NOT configured to GPIO by a reset,
// hence blinking on such a pin requires the additional step of
// configuring the pin as GPIO.
